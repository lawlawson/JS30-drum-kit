# JavaScript30 Drum Machine

This project is a part of the JavaScript30 challenge by Wes Bos, where participants build 30 different projects using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. In this particular project, we've created a drum machine where users can play various drum sounds by pressing corresponding keys on their keyboard or clicking on the drum pads using the mouse.
